# COVID-19 Data Analysis for Indian States

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the spread and impact of COVID-19 across 30 Indian states.  
It includes detailed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis and insights using visualization.

The main goal of this project:
- Find the most affected states
- Compare deaths and recovery
- Analyze rural vs urban healthcare capacity
- Identify key correlations and patterns

## 📊 Visualizations & Analysis

### ✔ State-wise analysis of all 30 states based on COVID confirmed cases
### ✔ Comparison of deaths across all 30 states
### ✔ Total hospitals per state  
### ✔ Rural vs urban beds comparison  
### ✔ Correlation heatmap  

These visuals helped identify:
- Which states were highly impacted
- Healthcare capacity comparison
- Valuable correlation between metrics

---

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Maharashtra was the most affected state.
- Urban healthcare facilities were higher than rural.
- States with higher healthcare infrastructure performed better.
- Total hospitals strongly correlate with total beds.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
The project shows the COVID-19 impact varied significantly across states.  
Healthcare infrastructure plays a major role in reducing death and risk.

---

## 💡 Recommendations
- Increase rural healthcare capacity
- Increase ICUs and emergency facilities
- Deploy more doctors in highly affected states
